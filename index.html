            <h1>Who the hell is this Titas Mallick?</h1>
            <p>This is Titas Mallick answering this question.
                Yes, I am Titas Mallick. Basically, a self-obsessed maniac who brags about himself in all of his online presence.
                I once was a good student of science, did my graduation and post-grad from the University of Calcutta with great grades. Then wasted 2 3 years of my life just thinking about what to do with my life yadi yada. And self-taught myself different skills like web development and video editing. But as a good student of botany, I was always fond of teaching. So this year I pursued a career as a biology teacher in a school. But as a freelancer, I love working as a web developer, video editor, graphics designer, and whatnot.
                So, welcome to the wasteland. Just being honest here.</p>

            <h1>What the f*** I do?</h1>
            <p>Ummm... in short a lot of things...</p>
            <p>Currently I tried working as a teacher of biology in a well-known school. It didn't worked out well, So started pursuing B.Ed degree in a B.Ed College.</p>
            <p>Working as an educator of my own Private Tutoring Center Eugenics Erudite.</p>
            <p>Acting as a graphics designer of a food group named foodyC, obviously co-owned by me as well. What else do you expect from a self-obsessed maniac anyway?</p>
            <p>Working as a Filmmaker of Creativegun. Surprise! also co-owned by me.</p>
            <p>And freelance video editing and web development. Self-learned Next js developer and love working in a serverless architecture.</p>
            <p>Ok, traditionally speaking jobless.</p>
